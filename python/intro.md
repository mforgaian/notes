#  Python

## Intro
* Python is interpreted, object oriented high level programming language with dynamic semantics.
* Rapid application development.
* Glue language to connect existing components together.
* There is no compilation step. Edit test debug cycle is incredibly fast.
* When interpreter discovers an error, it raises exception. When program doesn't catch the exception, the interpreter prints a stack trace.

## Python 2 or Python 3
* two versions are similar.
* Python 2.x will not be maintained past 2020.
* 
### Installation
* Most *nix based operating systems comes with Python by default. 
* Replacing the system Python is not recommended and may cause problems.
* Different versions of Python can be safely installed alongside the system Python.

## Python Interpreter
* Python interpreter is what used to run python scripts.
* python <filename.py> will invoke interpreter and run script.
### Python Interactive mode
* python followed by -i option will open interpreter in interactive mode.
```
python3 -i
```
### Zen of Python
zen of the python can be seen by typing following command in interactive mode
```
import this
```

## Pros and Cons
### Pros
* Open source.

### Cons
* It is slow language. So very bad language to use for developing general algorithms.

## Debugging
*
