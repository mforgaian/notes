# Unit Test
## What isn't a unit test
* Touches database
* Makes network requests
* Touches file system

## How to unit test
Jest
* Test runner
* Test blocks(e.g., describe and it)
* Assertions(e.g., expect(1+2).equal(3))
* Snapshot testing
Enzyme
* Shallow Rendering
* Inspecting Component Trees

BDD is better suited to UI based testing.
