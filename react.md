# React
React is a javascript library, used to build user interfaces on the frontend. React is the **view** layer of an MVC application.
React allows to write reusable components.
## components
## state
* all the methods should be pure functions. to changes self properties state need to be used.
* state is similar to props, but it is private and fully controlled by the component.
* this.state and this.props may be updated asynchronously for performance.
* When using React you should generally not need to call addEventListener to add listeners to a DOM element after it is created. Instead, just provide a listener when the element is initially rendered.

## props
## keys
## forms
## pulling data from an API
## Deploying React App
## Lifecycle
## Routes
