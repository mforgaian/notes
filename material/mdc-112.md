MDC Web's javascript layer is comprised of three classes per component
* The Component --- has a foundation, it role is to implement the adapter, provide public methods in foundation.
* Foundation --- Contains business logic that implements Material design. Foundation has an adapter.
* Adapter --- Adapter is an interface, referenced by the Foundation. Adapter can be implemented in different frameworks such as angular, react. An implementation of an adapter interacts with DOM structure.


Above pattern gives MDC Web the flexibility to integrate with frontend frameworks.
