# First Contentful Paint

## Intro
Load is not a single moment in time. It is an experience that no metric can full capture. 

FCP measures the time from navigation to the time when the browser renders the first bit of content from the DOM.

## Speeding up FCP
* minimize the render blocking external stylesheets and scripts.
* Using http caching to speed up repeated visits
* minify and compress text-based assets to speed up.
* Optimize javascript bootup.
